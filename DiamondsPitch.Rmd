# Exploring the diamonds dataset in ggplot2


```{r loadData, include=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
data(diamonds)
```
```{r showData, include = TRUE}
dim(diamonds)
summary(diamonds)
```

We can make several static plots based to better understand our dataset:

```{r plot1, include=TRUE, fig.height= 5}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x= carat, y = price, color = cut)) + geom_point()
```

---

```{r plot2, include = TRUE, fig.height = 5}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x=carat, y = price, color = color)) +geom_point()
```

<h5>We would need 90 plots to show all possible combinations of the features in the diamonds dataset. 


<h5>We can do this interactively in one shiny app. An example can be found at our <a href https://itnava.shinyapps.io/diamonds/> Shiny App </a> at https://itnava.shinyapps.io/diamonds/
